                <p>Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies
                <br>Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain
                <br>For we've received orders to sail for old England
                <br>We hope in a short time to see yous again</p>

                <p>We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors
                <br>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
                <br>Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England
                <br>From Ushant to Scilly 'tis thirty-five leagues</p>

                <p>We hove our ship to with the wind from sou'west, boys
                <br>We hove our ship to, for to strike soundings clear
                <br>It's forty-five fathoms, with a white sandy bottom
                <br>We squared our main yard and up channel did steer</p>
                        
                <p>We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors
                <br>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
                <br>Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England
                <br>From Ushant to Scilly 'tis thirty-five leagues</p>

                <p>Now the first land we sighted - it is called the Dodman
                <br>Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight
                <br>We sailed on by Beachy, by Fairlight, and Dungeness
                <br>And then we bore up for the South Foreland light</p>

                <p>We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors
                <br>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
                <br>Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England
                <br>From Ushant to Scilly 'tis thirty-five leagues</p>

                <p>Then the signal was given for the grand fleet to anchor
                <br>And all in the Downs that night for to lie
                <br>Let go your shank painter, likewise your cat-stopper
                <br>Haul up your clewgarnets, let tacks and sheets fly</p>

                <p>We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors
                <br>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
                <br>Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England
                <br>From Ushant to Scilly 'tis thirty-five leagues</p>

                <p>Now let ev'ry man drink off his full bumper
                <br>And let ev'ry man toss off his full glass
                <br>We'll sing and be jolly and drown melancholy
                <br>And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass</p>

                <p>We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors
                <br>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
                <br>Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England
                <br>From Ushant to Scilly 'tis thirty-five leagues</p>

            <p>On the Fourth of July, 1806
            <br>We set sail from the sweet Cove of Cork
            <br>We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
            <br>For the Grand City Hall in New York
            <br>'Twas a wonderful craft
            <br>She was rigged fore and aft
            <br>And oh, how the wild wind drove her
            <br>She stood several blasts
            <br>She had twenty seven masts
            <br>And they called her The Irish Rover</p>
            
            <p>We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
            <br>We had two million barrels of stones
            <br>We had three million sides of old blind horses hides'
            <br>We had four million barrels of bones
            <br>We had five million hogs
            <br>Six million dogs
            <br>Seven million barrels of porter
            <br>We had eight million sides of old nanny goate tails
            <br>In the hold of the Irish Rover</p>
            
            <p>There was awl Mickey Coote
            <br>Who played hard on his flute
            <br>And the ladies lined up for a set
            <br>He would tootle with skill
            <br>For each sparkling quadrille
            <br>Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
            <br>With his smart witty talk
            <br>He was cock of the walk
            <br>As he rolled the dames under and over
            <br>They all knew at a glance
            <br>When he took up his stance
            <br>That he sailed in The Irish Rover</p>
            
            <p>There was Barney McGee
            <br>From the banks of the Lee
            <br>There was Hogan from County Tyrone
            <br>There was Johnny McGurk
            <br>Who was scared stiff of work
            <br>And a man from Westmeath called Malone
            <br>There was Slugger O'Toole
            <br>Who was drunk as a rule
            <br>And Fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
            <br>And your man, Mick McCann
            <br>From the banks of the Bann
            <br>Was the skipper of the Irish Rover</p>
            
            <p>For a sailor it's always a bother in life
            <br>It's so lonesome by night and by day
            <br>That he longs for the shore
            <br>And a charming young whore
            <br>Who will melt all his troubles away
            <br>Oh, the noise and the rout
            <br>Swillin' poiteen and stout
            <br>For him soon the torment's over
            <br>Of the love of a maid he is never afraid
            <br>An old salt from the Irish Rover</p>
            
            <p>We had sailed seven years
            <br>When the measles broke out
            <br>And the ship lost its way in the fog
            <br>And that whale of a crew
            <br>Was reduced down to two
            <br>Just myself and the Captain's old dog
            <br>Then the ship struck a rock
            <br>Oh Lord! what a shock
            <br>The bulkhead was turned right over
            <br>Turned nine times around
            <br>And the poor old dog was drowned (1, 2, 3!)
            <br>I'm the last of The Irish Rover</p>

            <p>I thought I heard the Old Man say:
            <br>"Leave her, Johnny, leave her."
            <br>Tomorrow you will get your pay
